JFF i'm working on a wasm runtime. Goal of this project is just for fun. Learning and exploring the wasm format and
abstract vm.
Ill slowing add to this repo as I progress on this journey. This readme will be a living document
where I can add notes and update my roadmap. I'm hoping I can use this project for a blog post or two and
maybe a few videos and talks on how wasm works.

# build.sh

compiles all .wat files in the wat folder in .wasm fils in wasm folder. This is used
for testing purposes.
